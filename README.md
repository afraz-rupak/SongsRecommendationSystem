# SongsRecommendationSystem
Million Songs Dataset contains two files: triplet_file and metadata_file. The triplet_file contains user_id, song_id, and listen time. The metadata_file contains song_id, title, release, year, and artist_name. Million Songs Dataset is a mixture of songs from various websites with the rating that users gave after listening to the song.  There are three types of recommendation systems: content-based, collaborative, and popular.
